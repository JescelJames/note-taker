### What I learned:  

1. Organization in code makes it easier for me to read through.  The headers make it easy to navigate.
2. That to add to a data to json, data must be read, pushed, stringify, then write.   
3. Heroku app creation and deployment.
4. Using Insomnia Core to process server request.
5. That const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000 essentially creates a fallback to run the server.
6. .get and .post methods
7. Fallback routes is helpful for users.  
8. That InsomniaCore cannot do the same behavior as the browser and vice versa.
