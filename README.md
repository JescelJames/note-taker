# My Challenge: Create a Logo Generator with SVG

## Description
This challenge helps the user create a simple logo using Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.


### This is a Node js challenge: To help the user generate a simple logo using command line. 

- My motivation:  To build a simple log using user input from command-line
- Why I took this challege: To learn to create an SVG file using prompts from command-line.
- What the challenge solved:  The user can create a simple SVG file from prompts from command-line.

### What I learned:  

1. To add, commit often. I had to redo my index because I would not push up to github. This created rework and added time to the workload.
2. Testing a js file, doing test that runs as the changes happen in file.
3. To right-click on the index and open the terminal to properly run the node index.
4. That SVG and HTML are both based on XML.
5. That if I start small on testing, it becomes much faster.
6. That once I make change in my code, run it, then add/commit.  This seems to help me map in my head where I am at. Small chunking helps me a lot more than adding more lines of code before committing.
7. To write the code in big picture first, before diving in.
8. Psuedocoding helps, but I need more practice on it.  I understand the value, but I struggle to implement it.

## Code Description
This code can be accessed in terminal by running index.js file. type: node index.js in terminal and prompts will appear to create a logo.svg file.  Run the logo.svg file in browser to see the result.
