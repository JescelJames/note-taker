### What I learned:  

1. Organization in code makes it easier for me to read through.  The headers make it easy to navigate.
2. That to add to a data to json, data must be read, pushed, stringify, then write.   
3. Heroku app creation and deployment.
4. Using Insomnia Core to process server request.
5. That const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000 essentially creates a fallback to run the server.
6. That once I make change in my code, run it, then add/commit.  This seems to help me map in my head where I am at. Small chunking helps me a lot more than adding more lines of code before committing.
7. To write the code in big picture first, before diving in.
8. Psuedocoding helps, but I need more practice on it.  I understand the value, but I struggle to implement it.
